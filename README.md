# Exploring-Variations-in-Clustering-and-Predictive-Analysis
Project-2 Files of Introduction to data analytics course. We are performing clustering and classification on the given dataset. 

# Dataset details
This data set contains over 2,111 data entries for the people residing from Mexico to Peru to Colombia; accessibility is feasible to check obesity rates in people living in these countries. The study has mentioned different health outcomes via various measures and factors, such as dietary patterns, fitness, and so on, to conclude the overall health of the subject under examination. Each entry is meticulously categorized under the variable 'NObesity' (Obesity Level), which segments the population into seven nuanced groups namely Insufficient Weight, Normal Weight, Overweight Level I, Overweight Level II, Obesity Type I, Obesity Type II and Obesity Type III.


# Analysis
The analysis's conclusions include information about variables including the amount of time spent using technology, drinking water, eating habits, frequency of physical activity, and others that are linked to obesity levels. Different groups within the dataset are shown by clustering analysis, which may indicate various obesity risk profiles. With clusters serving as characteristics, the KNN classification model offers a potential method for somewhat accurately predicting obesity levels. Furthermore, by shedding light on the correlation between predictor variables and obesity levels, linear modeling facilitates a deeper comprehension of the variables that contribute to obesity. All things considered, the research provides insightful information about the obesity dataset, helping to uncover hidden patterns and influencing future interventions and obesity prevention strategies.
